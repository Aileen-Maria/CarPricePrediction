# CarPricePrediction
This project utilizes multiple machine learning models to predict car prices based on various features such as engine specifications, dimensions, and fuel type. The models are evaluated using RÂ² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to identify the most accurate and reliable predictor.
